- MongoDB: a NoSQL database used to store and manage data.
- Express: a backend web framework used to handle HTTP requests.
- Vue: a frontend JavaScript framework used to create user interfaces.
- Node.js: a server-side JavaScript runtime used to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- Tailwind CSS: a utility-first CSS framework used to style the frontend.
